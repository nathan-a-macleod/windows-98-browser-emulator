# windows-98-browser-emulator
An online windows 98 emulator that runs in the browser - uses the 98.css library (which is also on github).

Any contributions, will be appreciated. I am planning to eventually have a file-manager window where you can open things like a spreadsheet, text document, internet explorer, etc.
However if your contributions don't help address this, that doesn't matter.
